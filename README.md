## GREMessageType_GameStateMessage

Is one of the most helpful things, it is essentially a full sync of game state EXCEPT if a card has been introduced as a gameObject and the state has not changed, it which case it will just be referenced by the instanceId again. It's probably worth keeping track of our known objects

## actionsAvailableReq

These are things a user _actually_ can do

## bugs

So the big problem is that it mostly works at 11xx X 6xx resolutions. Need to retest the coords at a bigger window size

# land zone

the window is 1600 wide, 928 tall and at the position 96,50
150, 725
780, 725

28 is the bar

54, 675
684, 675

+28
0.03375, 0.6972

0.4275, 0.6972

the window is 1366 wide, 796 tall and at the position 213,50

right is 730x630
left is 330x630
